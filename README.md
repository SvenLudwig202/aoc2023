# Advent of Code 2023

This repository's sole purpose is hosting and tracking my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023. (https://adventofcode.com/2023)

I've chosen to use python for solving the individual problems this year.
All scripts were run on the Microsoft Store version of python 3.10.11 (64-bit).

Feel free to take inspiration and share feedback and criticism.
